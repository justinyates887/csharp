# C# Language Track

This repo is a journey through my solutions to Exercism.org's C# study course. Each folder represents a different project required to progress through the track, and should illustrate my journey through the language. Please check out exercism's free learning tools. Journey map will be indicated below, showing what the purpose of each project is in chronological order.

### Journey Map

1) The Basics: [Hello-World](./hello-world/HelloWorld.cs)
- > In this project, we implemented a simple "Hello World" return statement.

2) The Basics: [Lucians Lasagna](./lucians-luscious-lasagna/LuciansLusciousLasagna.cs) (Learn Returns and variables)
- > In this project, we dove more into class methods, returning logic through pre-determined integers. In potential scope, much of the project could be re-factored into a full class with a constructor, therefore object variables could be referenced in the sub-methods. This, however, was outside of the project scope.

3) Booleans: [Annalyns Infiltration](./annalyns-infiltration/AnnalynsInfiltration.cs) (Learn boolean operands and returns)
- > Here, we utilized boolean return values in the essence of game logic. I combined ternary conditional return statements for readability and re-use.

4) Strings: [Log Levels](./log-levels/LogLevels.cs)
- > This project was particularly challengeing. My goal was to get a return value which was optimized. Not knowing the .NET library, nor the syntax for C#, I had to rely 
on external help. The solution has my comments on how the code works, step by step, for my future reference.
