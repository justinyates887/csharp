# C# Language Track

**Due to lackluster formatting on Exercism's platforming, as well as unclear scopes and requirments, I have switched to Microsoft's official training curriculum for .NET and C#. All units after 6 were completed there. Advanced concepts after Exercism's courses will be included in this repo. Follow my progress at [Microsoft](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/users/justinyates-0980/)**

This repo is a journey through my solutions to [Exercism.org's](https://exercism.org) C# study course. Each folder represents a different project required to progress through the track, and should illustrate my journey through the language. Please check out exercism's free learning tools. Journey map will be indicated below, showing what the purpose of each project is in chronological order.

### Journey Map

These projects are listen in the order of completion. There are often multiple projects per topic, with rising diificulties.

1) The Basics: [Hello-World](./00-Basics/lucians-luscious-lasagna/hello-world/HelloWorld.cs)
> In this project, we implemented a simple "Hello World" return statement.

2) The Basics: [Lucians Lasagna](./00-Basics/lucians-luscious-lasagna/LuciansLusciousLasagna.cs) (Learn Returns and variables)
> In this project, we dove more into class methods, returning logic through pre-determined integers. In potential scope, much of the project could be re-factored into a full class with a constructor, therefore object variables could be referenced in the sub-methods. This, however, was outside of the project scope.

3) Booleans: [Annalyns Infiltration](./01-Booleans/annalyns-infiltration/AnnalynsInfiltration.cs) (Learn boolean operands and returns)
> Here, we utilized boolean return values in the essence of game logic. I combined ternary conditional return statements for readability and re-use.

4) Strings: [Log Levels](./02-Strings/log-levels/LogLevels.cs) (Learn string manipulation & concatination)
> This project was particularly challengeing. My goal was to get a return value which was optimized. Not knowing the .NET library, nor the syntax for C#, I had to rely 
on external help. The solution has my comments on how the code works, step by step, for my future reference.

5) If-Statements: [Cars, Assemble!](./03-IfStatements/cars-assemble/CarsAssemble.cs)
> In This project, the goal was to write three methods with if statements, returning the overall production rate of vehicles depending on the speed of production
and the rate of failure for increased speeds.

6) Extension Methods: [Log Analysis Pt. 2](./04-ExtensionMethods/log-analysis/LogAnalysis.cs)
> This project is incomplete due to lack of scope and requirments from the instructions. It is not my intention to play guesswork while learning a new library and language, therefore I will persue a different learning method until I am ready to seek challenges.
